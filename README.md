# HOMEWORK: Weather App!!!

![nedstark](./assets/nedstark.jpg)

Wait a second... I think I've heard that before...

Yup! You've built a weather app already, BUT tonight you will rebuild it using REACT! ðŸ˜‰

### A quick reminder of how your app should look:

#### Mobile

![mobile](https://git.generalassemb.ly/wdi-nyc-thundercats/HW_U02_D02_SQL_APIs/raw/master/weather/assets/mobile.jpg)

#### Desktop

.... but feel free to [get creative](http://statistician-ostritch-38230.bitballoon.com/).

### Open Weather API

Hopefully you remember working with the [Open Weather Map API](http://openweathermap.org/api). If you don't, check out the [original readme](https://git.generalassemb.ly/wdi-nyc-thundercats/HW_U02_D02_SQL_APIs/tree/master/weather).


## ðŸš€ Completion looks like:

Your app has multiple components and does the following things:

- Handles the zip code input from the user
- Fetches data from the API when the zip code is submitted
- Parses the information that comes back from the API call
- Renders that information on the page
- **BONUS**: Include the sunrise and sunset times (hint: maybe [Moment.js](https://momentjs.com/) will be helpful!) and some information about humidity, atmospheric pressure, etc.
- **BONUS**: Upload your completed weather app to BitBalloon.

Things to think about:

- Should your app have state?
- How/when would you change state?
- What way will you make the API call?


## ðŸš€ Your homework submission should include:

- A pull request created on _this repo_
- Completion, comfort, wins, losses, questions... you know the drill.

## This homework is due ðŸš¨ 11PM ON THURSDAY NIGHT ðŸš¨
